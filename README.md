# evaluative-proportional-representation
Evaluative proportional representation (EPR) guarantees that each citizens’ vote will continue to count proportionately in the deliberations of the legislative body, such as a city council. Each citizen knows that a candidate to whom they gave their highest available grade is elected. After assessing the ideal qualities needed by the office, citizens grade each candidate as either Excellent (ideal), Very Good, Good, Acceptable, or “Reject” (completely unsuitable).  Each voter can give the same grade to more than one candidate.
