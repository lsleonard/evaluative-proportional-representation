Step 1: Determine the elected candidates.
Step 2: Transfer votes from unelected candidates to those selected as winning candidates as follows:
Starting with the unelected candidate currently holding the largest number of affirmed evaluations, transfer all their votes that can be transferred automatically by the algorithm to any of the winners. If necessary, resolve any ties by lot.
[1] "Contingency 1: Fewer candates with votes 1  than positions to fill 7"
The number of winners that received affirmed evaluations by this stage in the count is fewer than the number of candidates to be elected.The winners selected ensure that each voter is as fully represented as possible in the legislature by the candidate they gave their highest grade. However, if a city or state wishes to require the target number of candidates to be elected even when the target number has not been elected by the above steps, the algorithm can be modified to achieve this result. At the same time, note that such a modification could also have the undesirable effect of partially wasting some citizens votes qualitatively.
The algorithm can be modified as follows:
Starting with the winning candidate who has the largest number of affirmed evaluations, automatically transfer one ballot chosen by lot to one of the candidates who has not yet received any votes. Do the same with such a ballot currently held by the winner with the second highest number of affirmed evaluations, then the third, etc. If necessary, repeat this action of one at a time transfers until each of the target number of winner has received at least one vote.

***This contingency is not yet implemented.***
