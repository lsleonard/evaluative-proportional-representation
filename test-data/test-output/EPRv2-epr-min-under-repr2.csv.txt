Step 1: Determine the elected candidates.
Step 2: Transfer votes from unelected candidates to those selected as winning candidates as follows:
Starting with the unelected candidate currently holding the largest number of affirmed evaluations, transfer all their votes that can be transferred automatically by the algorithm to any of the winners. If necessary, resolve any ties by lot.

Stage 3, Step 1: Select the 3 candidates to be elected.

Finalize the weighted votes of each winner as follows:
Starting with the candidate with the largest number of affirmed evaluations, publicly transfer all their proxy votes to any of the winners they find most suitable for office. Resolve any ties by lot.
Continuing with the candidate with the next most affirmed evaluations, publicly transfer their proxy votes as described for the first candidate to transfer, and continue the process until all proxy votes are transferred.
